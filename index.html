                <div class="bubble student">Hi, I'm a new student here. Can you help me understand how to register for
                    classes?</div>
                <div class="bubble chatbot">Hello! Of course, I can help with that. To get started, you'll need to log
                    into your student portal using the credentials provided to you.</div>
                <div class="bubble student">Got it. What's next after logging in?</div>
                <div class="bubble chatbot">Once you're logged in, you'll see a section for course registration. Click
                    on that, and you'll be able to view available courses for the upcoming semester.</div>
                <div class="bubble student">Okay, thanks. How do I know which courses to choose?</div>
                <div class="bubble chatbot">Good question! You should have received information about required courses
                    for your program. You can also speak with your academic advisor for guidance. If you have any
                    specific questions about courses, feel free to ask me!</div>
                <div class="bubble student">That makes sense. What about class timings? Can I see that while
                    registering?</div>
                <div class="bubble chatbot">Absolutely. When you browse through the available courses, you'll see their
                    timings and locations listed. Make sure to note these down so you can plan your schedule
                    accordingly.</div>
                <div class="bubble student">Great, thanks for the info. Is there anything else I should know about the
                    registration process?</div>
                <div class="bubble chatbot">Just a reminder to check for any prerequisites for the courses you're
                    interested in. If you need assistance at any step, don't hesitate to reach out. Happy to help!</div>
                <div class="bubble student">Thanks, you've been really helpful!</div>
                <div class="bubble chatbot">You're welcome! If you have any more questions in the future, just drop me a
                    message. Good luck with your registration!</div>
